You mast have local copy of boost library (see www.boost.org) and set include and libs files path in you IDE to the boost
(for example in VS 2005: go to Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories, 
push "Show directories for:" combo-box and select Include files, next add path to the boost).
